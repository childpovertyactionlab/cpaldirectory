We collect and analyze data from various sources, including government agencies, academic research, and community organizations, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the root causes and effects of child poverty. Our data encompasses local, state, and national levels to offer a complete picture of child poverty in Dallas.

We don't have any political affiliations or agendas, and our data is presented in a neutral and non-partisan way. We believe that everyone deserves access to accurate and unbiased data to make informed decisions about policies and programs.

## Contextual

We understand that data doesn't exist in a vacuum and that historical context is critical to understanding trends and patterns. That's why we provide data with historical context, allowing users to compare current data with data from the past. Our visualizations are designed to be user-friendly, enabling users to explore the data and analyze changes over time.

## People-Centric

At the Child Poverty Action Lab, we understand that child poverty affects different individuals and communities in unique ways. That's why we include data on different races, ethnicity, incomes, and family structures to provide a nuanced understanding of child poverty.
