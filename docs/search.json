We collect and analyze data from various sources, including government agencies, academic research, and community organizations, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the root causes and effects of child poverty. Our data encompasses local, state, and national levels to offer a complete picture of child poverty in Dallas.\nUnderstandable\nWe know that data can be overwhelming and difficult to understand, especially when it comes to complex social issues. That’s why we take the data we collect and make it easy to understand through reports and visualizations. We use clear, concise language and vibrant visuals to illustrate the data, making it accessible and understandable for everyone.\nFactual and Unbiased\nOur commitment to factual and unbiased data is at the core of everything we do. We rely on reliable and credible sources, including government agencies, to provide accurate data that is free from bias. We don’t have any political affiliations or agendas, and our data is presented in a neutral and non-partisan way. We believe that everyone deserves access to accurate and unbiased data to make informed decisions about policies and programs.\nContextual\nWe understand that data doesn’t exist in a vacuum and that historical context is critical to understanding trends and patterns. That’s why we provide data with historical context, allowing users to compare current data with data from the past. Our visualizations are designed to be user-friendly, enabling users to explore the data and analyze changes over time.\nPeople-Centric\nAt the Child Poverty Action Lab, we understand that child poverty affects different individuals and communities in unique ways. That’s why we include data on different races, ethnicities, incomes, and family structures to provide a nuanced understanding of child poverty. Ensuring that our data is people-centric and reflective of the diverse experiences of individuals and communities of Dallas"
