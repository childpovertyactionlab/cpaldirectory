These principles help to ensure that the data we release is accurate, reliable, and relevant and that it is used ethically and responsibly.\n\n\nComprehensive\nAt the Child Poverty Action Lab, we strive to provide a holistic view of child poverty and its impact on individuals, families, and communities. We collect and analyze data from various sources, including government agencies, academic research, and community organizations, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the root causes and effects of child poverty. Our data encompasses local, state, and national levels to offer a complete picture of child poverty in Dallas.\n\n\nUnderstandable\nWe know that data can be overwhelming and difficult to understand, especially when it comes to complex social issues. That’s why we take the data we collect and make it easy to understand through reports and visualizations. We use clear, concise language and vibrant visuals to illustrate the data, making it accessible and understandable for everyone.\n\n\nFactual and Unbiased\nOur commitment to factual and unbiased data is at the core of everything we do. We rely on reliable and credible sources, including government agencies, to provide accurate data that is free from bias. We don’t have any political affiliations or agendas, and our data is presented in a neutral and non-partisan way. We believe that everyone deserves access to accurate and unbiased data to make informed decisions about policies and programs.\n\n\nContextual\nWe understand that data doesn’t exist in a vacuum and that historical context is critical to understanding trends and patterns. That’s why we provide data with historical context, allowing users to compare current data with data from the past. Our visualizations are designed to be user-friendly, enabling users to explore the data and analyze changes over time.\n\n\nPeople-Centric\nAt the Child Poverty Action Lab, we understand that child poverty affects different individuals and communities in unique ways. That’s why we include data on different races, ethnicity, incomes, and family structures to provide a nuanced understanding of child poverty. Ensuring that our data is people-centric and reflective of the diverse experiences of individuals and communities of Dallas\n\nContact Us\nIf you’d like to set up a time to ask any data questions or need some help brainstorming come to our office hours!\n\n\n\n\nFor any other questions, please contact our team at (analytics@childpovertyactionlab.org)."

    "text": "Graphic Design Principles\nWhen creating graphics to share with stakeholders, it is important to consider key graphic design principles. These principles help ensure that the visuals effectively communicate information while maintaining clarity and transparency:\nSimplicity: Keep the design clean, uncluttered, and visually straightforward. Use minimalistic and intuitive elements that allow stakeholders to focus on the data without distractions.\nConsistency: Maintain a consistent visual style throughout your graphics, including colors, fonts, and icons. Consistency helps stakeholders easily understand and interpret the information presented.\nVisual Hierarchy: Arrange elements based on their importance and relevance. Use visual cues such as size, color, and position to guide stakeholders’ attention and emphasize key data points.\nClear Typography: Choose legible fonts and font sizes that ensure readability. Use typography strategically to highlight key findings or data points while maintaining overall coherence.\nColor Palette: Employ a cohesive color scheme that is visually appealing and enhances data comprehension. Ensure that color choices align with the intended message and accurately represent the underlying data.\nData Visualization: Select appropriate chart types, such as bar graphs, pie charts, or line graphs, based on the nature of the data. Use effective data visualization techniques to present complex information in a clear and accessible manner.\nLabeling and Annotation: Provide clear labels, titles, and annotations to help stakeholders understand the context and meaning of the data. Avoid ambiguity and provide necessary explanations to maintain transparency.\nData Accuracy and Transparency: Ensure that the data used in the graphics is accurate, up-to-date, and transparently sourced. Clearly cite the data origins and provide contextual information to promote trust and credibility.\nBy incorporating these graphic design principles, you can create visually appealing graphics that effectively communicate data to stakeholders while upholding transparency and facilitating easy comprehension and interpretation of the information presented.\n\n\nInstalling Poppins\nYour computer may not have the Poppins font installed. If it is not installed, please install the free Poppins font from Google. Below are step by step instructions:\nDownload the Poppins font (as a zip file). Unzip the file on your computer.

Consistency helps stakeholders easily understand and interpret the information presented.\nVisual Hierarchy: Arrange elements based on their importance and relevance. Use visual cues such as size, color, and position to guide stakeholders’ attention and emphasize key data points.\nClear Typography: Choose legible fonts and font sizes that ensure readability. Use typography strategically to highlight key findings or data points while maintaining overall coherence.\nColor Palette: Employ a cohesive color scheme that is visually appealing and enhances data comprehension. Ensure that color choices align with the intended message and accurately represent the underlying data.\nData Visualization: Select appropriate chart types, such as bar graphs, pie charts, or line graphs, based on the nature of the data. Use effective data visualization techniques to present complex information in a clear and accessible manner.\nLabeling and Annotation: Provide clear labels, titles, and annotations to help stakeholders understand the context and meaning of the data. Avoid ambiguity and provide necessary explanations to maintain transparency.\nData Accuracy and Transparency: Ensure that the data used in the graphics is accurate, up-to-date, and transparently sourced. Clearly cite the data origins and provide contextual information to promote trust and credibility.\nBy incorporating these graphic design principles, you can create visually appealing graphics that effectively communicate data to stakeholders while upholding transparency and facilitating easy comprehension and interpretation of the information presented."
